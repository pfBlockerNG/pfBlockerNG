#!/bin/sh
# /usr/local/etc/rc.d/pfblockerng_repo_generate.sh — boot-time repo-conf
# regenerator (ADR-39). Installed by install.sh.
#
# WHAT IT DOES (and nothing more): for each pfBlockerNG pkg-repo conf file that
# EXISTS, it detects this box's pfSense edition/version and overwrites the conf
# with the canonical body — a fully-resolved catalog URL for the box's variant
# (ADR-17 / ADR-20) plus a marker comment. No pkg call, no network fetch, no
# snapshot, no reconcile. It is a conf REGENERATOR: re-deriving the conf from
# scratch is strictly simpler — and never wrong — than diffing and patching one
# in place.
#
# The one thing it does NOT re-derive is the catalog BASE. With no environment
# (which is every boot) the base is read back out of the conf's own url, so only
# the <varver> moves; a fork site, a staging prefix and a `file://` guest
# catalogue survive a reboot instead of being redirected to the primary Pages
# site, and a url this hook could not have written is left alone (issue #2459).
#
# WHY AT BOOT: a pfSense OS upgrade can change the box's edition/version (which
# requires a reboot), which moves the catalog subtree. Regenerating every boot
# keeps the conf aligned with no upgrade hook to register.
#
# rc.d ordering: REQUIRE FILESYSTEMS (so /usr/local is mounted) and
# BEFORE NETWORKING (so the conf is correct before anything that could invoke
# pkg over the network runs). Safe to run this early precisely because it is
# local-file-only — it touches no network and no daemon.
#
# HARD RULE: every path ends in `exit 0`. This hook MUST NEVER wedge boot.
#
# Detection (KISS): edition = "/etc/product_label contains 'Plus'" -> plus, else
# ce; version = major.minor of /etc/version, with any dash suffix (e.g.
# "-BETA"/"-RC") stripped FIRST. This MIRRORS catalog_name_from_version() in
# scripts/build-repo-portable.py exactly, including that strip: a live box's
# /etc/version can carry a pre-release suffix the matrix's version never does
# (issue #1786), and the producers strip it identically so a pre-release box and
# the publisher agree on one catalog dir (issue #1965). Arch-less since issue #1806 (NO_ARCH) — the catalog
# no longer has a per-arch leaf, so this hook no longer calls `pkg` at all (it
# used to read `pkg config abi` only to derive that leaf).
#
# The emitted conf body is BYTE-IDENTICAL to `build-repo.sh --print-conf` and
# `build-repo-portable.py --print-conf` (pinned by tests/test_repo_conf_generators.py).
#
# POSIX sh only; quote all expansions.

# shellcheck shell=sh
#
# FreeBSD rc.d script: rc.subr's run_rc_command dispatches the *_start handler
# via indirect variables, so shellcheck cannot see those call sites — SC2317
# (unreachable command) and SC2034 ($rcvar assigned-but-unused) are false
# positives here.

# Recover the catalog base a conf was last generated from. $1 = conf path,
# $2 = channel word. The canonical url is "<base>/<channel>/<varver>", so the
# base is what is left after stripping the two trailing segments — and the
# channel segment MUST equal this conf's own channel, which is what makes the
# url recognisably one this hook wrote.
#
# WHY (issue #2459): at boot there is no environment, so composing the url from
# a hardcoded default rewrote every conf to the primary Pages site — a fork
# site, a staging prefix and a `file://` guest catalogue all silently became
# https://pfblockerng.github.io/pkg, redirecting where the box fetches packages
# from. Reading the base back out of the conf keeps the OS-upgrade job the hook
# exists for (move the <varver>) without moving anything else.
#
# Prints the base on success. Returns 1 ONLY when the conf carries no url line at
# all (an install.sh stub pending first generation — the caller falls back to the
# built-in default); 2 whenever a url IS present but is not one this hook could
# have written (the caller leaves the conf alone). The discriminator is the
# presence of the url line, never whether the pattern below matched it:
# unquoted and single-quoted strings are valid UCL an operator can hand-write,
# and an unterminated quote is what a botched hand edit leaves behind — treating
# any of those as a pending stub would rewrite them from the built-in default,
# which is the redirect this whole guard exists to prevent.
