# /usr/local/etc/rc.d/pfblockerng_repo_generate.sh — boot-time repo-conf
# regenerator (ADR-39). Installed by the per-channel install-<ch>.sh scripts (and the legacy add-repo.sh).
#
# WHAT IT DOES (and nothing more): for each pfBlockerNG pkg-repo conf file that
# EXISTS, it detects this box's pfSense edition/version and UNCONDITIONALLY
# overwrites the conf with the canonical body — a fully-resolved GitHub Pages
# catalog URL for the box's variant (ADR-17 / ADR-20) plus a marker comment.
# No pkg call, no network fetch, no snapshot, no parse-and-compare, no
# reconcile. It is a pure conf REGENERATOR: re-deriving the conf from scratch is
# strictly simpler — and never wrong — than diffing and patching one in place.
#
# WHY AT BOOT: a pfSense OS upgrade can change the box's edition/version (which
# requires a reboot), which moves the catalog subtree. Regenerating every boot
# keeps the conf aligned with no upgrade hook to register.
#
# rc.d ordering: REQUIRE FILESYSTEMS (so /usr/local is mounted) and
# BEFORE NETWORKING (so the conf is correct before anything that could invoke
# pkg over the network runs). Safe to run this early precisely because it is
# local-file-only — it touches no network and no daemon.
#
# HARD RULE: every path ends in `exit 0`. This hook MUST NEVER wedge boot.
#
# Detection (KISS): edition = "/etc/product_label contains 'Plus'" -> plus, else
# ce; version = major.minor of /etc/version, with any dash suffix (e.g.
# "-BETA"/"-RC") stripped FIRST. This MIRRORS catalog_name_from_version() in
# scripts/build-repo-portable.py exactly, including that strip: a live box's
# /etc/version can carry a pre-release suffix the matrix's version never does
# (issue #1786), and the producers strip it identically so a pre-release box and
# the publisher agree on one catalog dir (issue #1965). Arch-less since issue #1806 (NO_ARCH) — the catalog
# no longer has a per-arch leaf, so this hook no longer calls `pkg` at all (it
# used to read `pkg config abi` only to derive that leaf).
#
# The emitted conf body is BYTE-IDENTICAL to `add-repo.sh --print-conf`,
# `build-repo.sh --print-conf`, and `build-repo-portable.py --print-conf`
# (pinned by tests/test_add_repo_conf.py).
#
# POSIX sh only; quote all expansions.

# shellcheck shell=sh
#
# FreeBSD rc.d script: rc.subr's run_rc_command dispatches the *_start handler
# via indirect variables, so shellcheck cannot see those call sites — SC2317
# (unreachable command) and SC2034 ($rcvar assigned-but-unused) are false
# positives here.
