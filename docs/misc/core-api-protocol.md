# Core API protocol

Scope: the HTTP+JSON API of the pfBlockerNG Core daemon (`go/pfb_core`, binary `pfb-core`, issue #3841; map #3813), the
conventions every Core method follows, the settings methods and store (issue #3842), who may call it, and how the package
runs it. Load when: adding a Core method or settings projection, calling Core from PHP or another local process, or
changing `go/pfb_core`, `pfb_core_service()` or `pfb_core_call()`.

Core is its own process and binary, separate from `pfb-dns`: either keeps running when the other fails. It runs whether
pfB-DNS is enabled or not.

## Transport

- HTTP/1.1 over a Unix socket. pfSense: `/var/run/pfb_core/api.sock`.
- One path per method: `POST /v1/<Method>`, for example `/v1/GetVersion`. The version is in the path. An incompatible change
  is `/v2`; within `v1` only compatible additions are made (a new method, a new optional parameter, a new reply field).
- The request body is one JSON object: the method's parameters. An empty body is the empty object `{}`. Anything else, a
  second value after the object included, is `invalid_argument`. An unknown parameter is `invalid_argument` with a field
  error naming it.
- Every reply to a request that reached a method's routing is one JSON object, `Content-Type: application/json`,
  `Cache-Control: no-store`. A client ignores reply fields it does not know. A request that is not valid HTTP (a malformed
  or oversized header) gets Go's own plain-text `400` or `431` before any routing.
- Any HTTP method but `POST` is `method_not_allowed` (`Allow: POST`). A path that is not `/v1/<a method Core has>` is
  `not_found`, an unknown version included.

The method names and shapes are transport-neutral (map #3813, accepted proposal): a gRPC adapter can serve the same methods.

## Methods

| Method | Parameters | Reply |
|---|---|---|
| `GetVersion` | none | `{"service": "pfblockerng-core", "apiVersion": "v1", "status": "serving"}` |
| `GetSettingsSchema` | none | the native schema: `{"schemaVersion", "projections": [{"id", "fields": [...]}]}` |
| `GetSettings` | `projectionIds` (optional; none: all) | `{"initialized", "revision", "projections": [{"resourceId", "generation", "value"}]}` |
| `InitializeSettings` | `requestId`, `settings` | `{"revision": 1, "projections": [...]}`: every projection |
| `SaveSettings` | `requestId`, `expectedRevision`, `changes` | `{"revision", "projections": [...]}`: the projections whose value changed |

`GetVersion` is also the health check: a `200` with `status` `serving` means Core takes requests.

## Settings

Core's native settings (issue #3842). PHP will translate between pfSense settings and these; no pfSense page reads them
yet.

- **Schema.** A projection is a group of fields, published as the resource `settings/<id>`. A field has a `name`, a
  `type` (`bool`, `int`, `enum`, `string`) and a `default`. It may also have:
  - `enum`: the allowed values;
  - `min` / `max`;
  - `secret: true`;
  - `requires`: a bool field of the same projection; while that one is false, this bool is held false.
- **Revision and generations.** The configuration *revision* is the optimistic lock: it is 1 after `InitializeSettings`
  and advances on every accepted `SaveSettings`. A projection's *generation* is 1 after initialization and advances only
  when its value changes.
- **`settings` / `changes`.** An object of projection id → field → value. JSON `null` resets a field to its default.
  `InitializeSettings` fills every field it is not given with its default.
- **Validation.** The whole resulting configuration is checked before anything is written. Any error rejects it all:
  `invalid_argument`, with one field error per fault (`changes.dns.decisionCacheMax`, `changes.<unknown projection>`).
- **Conflicts** (`conflict`):
  - `InitializeSettings` on an initialized Core;
  - `SaveSettings` before initialization;
  - `SaveSettings` whose `expectedRevision` is not the current revision (a field error names `expectedRevision`). The
    client reads again and reapplies its change.
- **No run.** A save starts no run.
- **Secrets are write-only.** A read shows a secret field as `{"present": true|false}`, never its value.
- **Store.** One document, `settings.json`, in `--state-dir` (0600, in a 0700 directory). A save writes
  `settings.json.tmp`, syncs it, renames it into place and syncs the directory, so a crash leaves the previous
  revision readable. A store file Core cannot read stops the start; Core never comes up uninitialized over it.

### Projection `dns`

The DNSBL resolver settings `pfb-dns` reads from `pfb_unbound.ini` today. `pfb-dns` will fetch them as `settings/dns`
(map #3813, owner 2026-11-12). The field list with registry keys is on [#3842](https://github.com/pfBlockerNG/pfBlockerNG/issues/3842#issuecomment-6834529521).

| Field | Type, default |
|---|---|
| `replyLogging`, `hstsNullBlocking`, `pslIncludePrivate`, `idnBlockMalicious` | bool, `true` |
| `tldWildcard`, `pslAllowPrivate`, `idnEscalateSuspicious`, `logViaWebserver`, `cnameValidation`, `control`, `regexCap`, `metricsClientIp` | bool, `false` |
| `controlLegacy` | bool, `false`; `requires` `control` |
| `pslFeedPrivatePolicy`, `pslFeedIcannPolicy` | enum `ignore` / `apex` / `honor`, `honor` |
| `idnMode` | enum `off` / `confusable` / `on`, `off` |
| `decisionCacheMax` | int 0 to 5000000 (0: unlimited), `10000` |

Parity fixture: `tests/core/fixtures/settings_dns_parity.json`. `CoreSettingsDnsParityTest` (PHPUnit) freezes it against
today's PHP. `go/pfb_core/settings/parity_test.go` runs Core against it.

## Errors

Every error is the same envelope, with the HTTP status its code maps to:

```json
{"error": {"code": "invalid_argument", "message": "a mutating method needs a valid requestId",
  "fieldErrors": [{"field": "requestId", "message": "required"}]}}
```

`fieldErrors` is present only when a named parameter is at fault. `message` is for people; a client decides on `code`.

| `code` | HTTP | When |
|---|---|---|
| `invalid_argument` | 400 | Body not one JSON object, unknown or mistyped parameter, bad or missing `requestId` |
| `unauthenticated` | 401 | The caller is not an admitted local process (see [Local authentication](#local-authentication)) |
| `not_found` | 404 | No such method, or no such API version |
| `method_not_allowed` | 405 | Not `POST` |
| `conflict` | 409 | A `requestId` reused with a different body; a settings call the store's state refuses ([Settings](#settings)) |
| `payload_too_large` | 413 | Body over the limit |
| `internal` | 500 | The method failed unexpectedly or ran past its deadline (logged); also any code a method returns that is not in this table |
| `unavailable` | 503 | A repeat of a `requestId` whose first request still ran when the repeat's own deadline passed |

## requestId and replay

A mutating method (`InitializeSettings`, `SaveSettings`) takes a `requestId` in its parameters: a string of 1 to
128 printable ASCII characters without spaces. The method declares `requestId` in its own parameters, since unknown
parameters are refused. The client makes one per logical operation (a UUID will do) and sends it
again, with the byte-identical body, to resolve an unknown outcome such as a timeout.

- The first request with a `requestId` runs the method, to its end even when its caller disconnects (up to the method
  deadline). Every repeat with the same method, `requestId` and body gets the
  first response, status and bytes, whatever it was (an error included), and the method does not run again.
- A repeat that arrives while the first still runs waits for its result; it never runs the method itself.
- The same `requestId` with a different body is `conflict`, and nothing runs.
- Core remembers the last 4096 finished `requestId`s (one still running is never forgotten), in memory only: a
  restarted Core remembers none. A client that cannot tell
  whether its request ran before a restart reads the state it changed instead of repeating it.

A read-only method takes no `requestId` and is never replayed.

## Limits and timeouts

| Limit | Value |
|---|---|
| Request body | 1 MiB (`payload_too_large` above) |
| Request header | 16 KiB |
| Reading the header | 5 s; a client that has not sent it by then is disconnected |
| Reading the whole request | 10 s |
| Running a method | 25 s (its context is cancelled) |
| Writing the reply | 45 s from the end of the header (covers the body read and the method) |
| Idle keep-alive connection | 60 s |

## Local authentication

**Decision: Unix socket, file permissions plus the kernel's credential of the caller.** Only processes on the pfSense host
can reach a Unix socket at all, so Core is unreachable from any other host by construction, with no listener and no
firewall rule to get wrong. Each connection's uid comes from the kernel (`LOCAL_PEERCRED` on FreeBSD, `SO_PEERCRED` on
Linux), so there is no secret to create, store, rotate or leak. PHP reaches the socket with native curl
(`CURLOPT_UNIX_SOCKET_PATH`). Loopback TCP plus a token file was rejected: any local user can connect to loopback, so
everything would rest on keeping the token file secret, and a client would need to read it.

Two fences, each enough on its own against an unprivileged user:

1. **File permissions.** Core creates the socket's directory mode 0700 and the socket 0600, both its own (root's). An
   existing directory is used only while it is a real directory (not a symlink) of Core's user with mode 0700 or 0750;
   anything else, a shared directory such as `/tmp` included, stops the start instead of being changed. Another
   user cannot even connect (`EACCES`).
2. **Caller uid.** Every request is checked against the admitted uids. Any other caller gets `unauthenticated` and no
   method runs.

Flags: `--allow-uid UID` is the privileged caller (default 0, root: PHP on pfSense). Each `--client-uid UID` admits one more
local client. `--socket-group GID` opens the socket's directory (0750) and the socket (0660) to that group, so a client that
is not root can connect. Even then, the uid check decides who is served: group membership alone is not enough.

**A second local client: pfb-dns.** pfb-dns will fetch `dnsbl/*` and its settings from Core over this API (map #3813). It
drops privileges to its own user after start. The pfb-dns ticket admits it by adding `--client-uid <that user's uid>` and
`--socket-group <a group of that user>` to Core's rc line; Core needs no new code. pfb-dns runs as `unbound` today, so
admitting that uid admits every process of that user, Unbound included. A dedicated pfb-dns user narrows that, and the
pfb-dns ticket decides it.

## On pfSense

| What | Where |
|---|---|
| Binary | `/usr/local/pkg/pfblockerng/core/bin/freebsd-amd64/pfb-core`, `.../freebsd-arm64/pfb-core` (static, `CGO_ENABLED=0`; built by `scripts/build-pfb-dns.py`) |
| rc script | `/usr/local/etc/rc.d/pfb_core.sh`, written by `pfb_core_service()`; pfSense service `pfb_core` |
| Supervisor | `daemon(8) -r -R 5 -t pfb_core`, pidfiles `/var/run/pfb_core_daemon.pid` (supervisor) and `/var/run/pfb_core.pid` (pfb-core) |
| Log | `/var/log/pfblockerng/core.log` (pfb-core's stderr, through `daemon -o`) |
| Socket | `/var/run/pfb_core/api.sock` |
| State (`--state-dir`) | `/usr/local/etc/pfb_core` (0700): outside `/var`, so it survives a RAM-disk reboot |

- **Start** keeps a pfb_core supervisor that already runs. Otherwise it runs this machine's binary (picked by `uname -p`).
  A package without an executable `pfb-core` for this machine starts nothing and logs why. That is not a failure. An
  unknown machine is a failure.
- **Stop** sends TERM to the supervisor and to pfb-core, then KILL at 5 s. It signals a process only while its pidfile names it
  and its command line is pfb_core's, so a reused pid is never signalled. pfb-core finishes the requests in flight (up to
  3 s) and removes its socket.
- **Package lifecycle.** The install and every upgrade regenerate the script and restart the service. pfSense starts it at
  boot with the package's services. A removal stops it and deletes the script.
- **Paths.** Core reads every path from a flag. It names no pfSense path and imports nothing but the standard library and
  its own packages. `go/pfb_core/boundary_test.go` enforces this, build-constrained files included, and fails on a
  violation. The CI Go gate (`test.yml` `go-quality`, `scripts/agent/run-gates.sh`) runs it.

Log lines (stderr): `serving API v1 on <socket> for uid <uid>, clients [<uids>]` once it listens; `refused a caller of uid
<uid>: ...` per refused request; `<Method> failed: ...` for an internal error; `stopped` after a clean stop.

## Calling from PHP

```php
$r = pfb_core_call('GetVersion');
// ['status' => 200, 'body' => ['service' => 'pfblockerng-core', 'apiVersion' => 'v1', 'status' => 'serving'], 'error' => NULL]
```

`pfb_core_call($method, $params)` posts `$params` as one JSON object. It returns the HTTP status and the decoded reply
object, the error envelope included. When no HTTP reply came (Core down, socket missing, timeout: connect 5 s, total
30 s), `status` is 0 and `error` says why. Pinned by `PfbCoreCallTest`; the rc script by `PfbCoreServiceTest`; the
server by `go/pfb_core/*_test.go`.
